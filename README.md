# RealTime-TicTacToe
This is my internship project, playing TicTacToe with a computer. The aim is to teach myself basic computer vision techniques as well as have some fun. Check out my [unnecessarily long demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5urz_VfivM&t=8s) if you want to see it in action. It is not very amazing though.

MATLAB source code is under /MATLABfiles folder. In addition, a MATLAB app is available in .mlapp format, should be ready to be used. You need a blank A4 paper, a dark pen and some patience (you cannot view yourself in .mlapp because it takes long time to render all the stuff without GPU, so I removed camera view). Draw a grid, make your move and show it to the camera (preferibly, put it close). If you take long time, the app may collapse due to unnecessary computations... This project is computationally inefficient, but I am not planning to revisit in near future.

Have fun!
